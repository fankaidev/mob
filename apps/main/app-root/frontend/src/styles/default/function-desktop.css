 * 🎨 STYLE DIRECTION - Desktop
 * Expand and develop your design based on the following style direction.

 * Not yet defined. Use the gen-style skill to generate a style direction.

 * ==============================================
 *
 * PINNED REFERENCE — DO NOT DELETE
 *
 * Cards Layout (reference patterns):
 *
 * Dimension 1 — Direction:
 *   - Vertical: image top, text bottom — `flex flex-col`
 *   - Horizontal: image side, text beside — `flex flex-row`
 *
 * Dimension 2 — Image-container relationship:
 *
 *   1. No-container ★: no card background or padding — image is the visual
 *      anchor, text sits outside. Clean and hard to mess up.
 *      - Wrapper `flex flex-col gap-3` → Image `w-full` + Text area
 *      - Wrapper `flex gap-3` → Image + Text area
 *
 *   2. Overlay ★: text/actions layered on top of image (absolute positioning)
 *      - Card `relative overflow-hidden` → Image `w-full h-full object-cover`
 *        + Overlay `absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 p-4` (typically with gradient scrim)
 *
 *   3. Padded: image inside padding, gap between image and card edge.
 *      Overused, generic-looking. Use sparingly.
 *      - Card `p-4 flex flex-col gap-4` → Image `w-full` + Text area
 *      - Card `flex gap-4 p-4` → Image `h-full` + Text area
 *
 *   4. Edge-to-edge: image bleeds to card edge (top or full-width), text area
 *      has its own padding. Most generic card pattern — looks AI-generated. Avoid.
 *      - Card `flex flex-col overflow-hidden` → Image `w-full` (no margin) + Text area `p-4`
 *      - Card `flex overflow-hidden` → Image (flush to edge) + Text area `p-4`
 *
 * Additional Notes:
 * - Colors: always use Tailwind arbitrary hex values (`bg-[#hex]`, `text-[#hex]`).
 * - Do NOT use side accent bars (single-edge colored bars) as selection or status indicators. This pattern is extremely error-prone and strongly discouraged — avoid entirely.
